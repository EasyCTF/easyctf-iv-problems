I'm trying to get the flag from `c1.easyctf.com:12488`, but it's asking me for a password I don't know..

Fortunately, I found this service on the shell server called `/problems/flagclient` that can help me get it! But it's not being very nice to me:( See if you can do better.

Some useful information:

- Player key: `${seed}`
- It's sending over interface `eth0`
- Please don't brute-force anything
