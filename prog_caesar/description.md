You can decode a Caesar cipher, but can you write a program to decode a Caesar cipher?

Your program will be given 2 lines of input, and your program needs to output the original message.

- First line contains `N`, an integer representing how much the key was shifted by. `1 <= N <= 26`
- Second line contains the ciphertext, a string consisting of lowercase letters and spaces.

For example:

```
6
o rubk kgyeizl
```

You should print

```
i love easyctf
```
