This problem has multiple parts:

 - Find that the encrypted file is a png, and open it
 - Understand the small-step semantics on the image
   - Basically it says that the "flag" feature of the language reveals a flag when there are globally defined variables "username" and "password" set to root and the proper password
 - The proper password can be found hidden at the end of the hex in the encrypted file
 - Enter the appropriate things into the repl while nc'd to the server

Done!
