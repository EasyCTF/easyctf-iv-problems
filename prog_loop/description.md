over and over and over and over and over and ...

Given a number `N`, print the string "over [and over]" such that the string contains `N` "over"s. There should _not_ be newlines in the string.

For example:

- For `N` = 1, print "over".
- For `N` = 5, print "over and over and over and over and over".

- For Python, consider using `for` and `range`.
- For Java/CXX, consider using a `for` loop.

Try doing it with `while` too for practice!
