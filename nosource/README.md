# Stop looking at the source code

An annoying problem whose flag is literally in the source code, but
uses some dumb anti-devtools tricks to keep you from finding it.

To-do list:
- [x] Figure out what to do for non-Chrome browsers
- [x] Minify `mod-bootstrap.min.js` and prepend the actual file :')
- [x] Create a better flag and a `grader.py`
- [ ] Figure out how to set up server
- [ ] Add link to description
