All you CTFers are sure getting on my nerves with your source-viewing and
developer tools-ing! Alas, despite my best wishes, the experienced programmers
on the wonderful website StackOverflow tell me that it's

to keep you from looking at the HTML. But a disable right click script
certainly won't stop an experienced CTFer like you! So finding the flag
in the source of this problem should be no trouble,
