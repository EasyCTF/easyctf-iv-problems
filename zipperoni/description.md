I've created a dastardly chain of
[zip files](${zip_files_tar}).
Now you'll never find my flag!

The first file is `begin.zip`, with password `coolkarni`.

*Hint:* You need to guess the password of the next zip file. However, the underscores in the pattern appear in the same positions as they do in the actual password, so you don't need to guess them. For example, the first pattern is `__0_0_`, which means that you need to guess the 3rd and 5th characters.
