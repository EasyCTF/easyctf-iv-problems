Sometimes, the differences matter. Especially between the files in [this archive](${file_tar}).

Hint: This is a [TAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(computing)) archive file. You can extract the files inside this tar by navigating to the directory where you downloaded it and running `tar xf file.tar`! If you don't have `tar` on your personal computer, you could try doing it from the Shell server. Once you extract the files, try comparing the hex encodings of the files against the first file.
