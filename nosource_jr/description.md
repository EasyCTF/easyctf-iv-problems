I don't like it when people try to view source on my page. Especially when
I put all this effort to put my flag verbatim into the source code, but
then people just look at the source to find the flag! How annoying.

This time, when I write my wonderful website, I'll have to hide my beautiful
flag to prevent you CTFers from stealing it, dagnabbit. We'll see what you're
[able to find](http://c1.easyctf.com:12486/jr/)...
